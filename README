In order to practice Haskell, I'm writing an assembler for the Hack Assembly language as specified in "The Elements of Computing Systems". This is also a chance to get used to using GitHub.

Heads up, the API for these modules aren't followed exactly because the book assumes we are using an imperative language and global variables.  Everything should still work correctly!

Feel free to give me any feedback on my Haskell implementation!
